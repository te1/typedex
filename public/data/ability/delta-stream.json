A mysterious air current causes moves to not be super effective against Flying; they do neutral damage instead.  []{ability:anticipation} and []{move:stealth-rock} are not affected.\n\nThe mysterious air current ends when this Pokémon leaves battle or loses this ability, or when this ability is nullified.  The weather cannot otherwise be changed except by the effects of []{ability:desolate-land} and []{ability:primordial-sea}.\n\n[]{ability:air-lock} and []{ability:cloud-nine} will prevent the effect of a mysterious air current, but will not allow the weather to be changed."
