Covet, Thief, and Knock Off still inflict damage against this Pokémon.  Unlike with []{ability:sticky-hold}, this Pokémon cannot use []{move:fling}, Switcheroo, or Trick to lose its item itself, nor gain an item through Switcheroo or Trick if it does not have one.\n\nThis ability has no effect for any Pokémon other than []{pokemon:arceus}.  This ability cannot be traded with []{move:skill-swap}, nor copied with []{move:role-play} or []{ability:trace}, nor disabled with []{move:gastro-acid}, nor changed with []{move:worry-seed}.  This Pokémon cannot use Skill Swap or Role Play to lose its ability itself.  []{ability:mold-breaker} cannot ignore this ability.\n\nIf a Pokémon [Transforms]{move:transform} into an Arceus with this ability, it will Transform into Arceus's default, []{type:normal}-type form.  If the Transforming Pokémon is holding a Plate, this ability will then activate and change the Pokémon into the corresponding form."
