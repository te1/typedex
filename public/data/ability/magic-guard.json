    "full": "This Pokémon is immune to damage not directly caused by a move.\n\nFor example, this Pokémon takes no damage from from [weather]{mechanic:weather}, recoil, [status ailments]{mechanic:status-ailments}, or []{move:spikes}, but it still suffers from the [Attack]{mechanic:attack} cut when [burned]{mechanic:burn}, and a []{item:life-orb} will still power up this Pokémon's moves without damaging it.  Anything that directly depends on such damage will also not happen; for example, []{move:leech-seed} will neither hurt this Pokémon nor heal the opponent, and Pokémon with a []{item:jaboca-berry} or []{item:rowap-berry} will not consume the berry when hit by this Pokémon.\n\nThe following are unaffected: []{move:struggle}, []{move:pain-split} (whether used by or against this Pokémon), []{move:belly-drum}, []{move:substitute}, []{move:curse}, moves that knock the user out, and damage from [confusion]{mechanic:confusion}.\n\nThis Pokémon will neither lose nor regain [HP]{mechanic:hp} if it drains HP from a Pokémon with []{ability:liquid-ooze}.\n\nIf this Pokémon is [badly poisoned]{mechanic:poison}, the poison counter is still increased each turn; if the Pokémon loses this ability, it will begin taking as much damage as it would be if it had been taking increasing damage each turn."
