Other Pokémon's Water moves raise this Pokémon's [Special Attack]{mechanic:special-attack} one [stage]{mechanic:stat-modifier}, negating any other effect on it, and cannot miss it.\n\nIf the move's intended target also has this ability, the move is not redirected.  When multiple Pokémon with this ability are possible targets for redirection, the move is redirected to the one with the highest [Speed]{mechanic:speed} stat, or, in the case of a tie, to a random tied Pokémon.  []{move:follow-me} takes precedence over this ability."
