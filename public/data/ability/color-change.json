The Pokémon must directly take damage; for example, moves blocked by a []{move:substitute} will not trigger this ability, nor will moves that deal damage indirectly, such as []{move:spikes}.\n\nThis ability takes effect on only the last hit of a multiple-hit attack.\n\nIn Pokémon Colosseum and XD: Gale of Darkness, this ability does not take effect on Shadow-type moves."
