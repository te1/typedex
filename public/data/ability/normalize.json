Moves of variable type, such as []{move:hidden-power}, are affected.  They otherwise work as usual, however; []{move:weather-ball}, for example, is always forced to be Normal, but it still has doubled power and looks different during [weather]{mechanic:weather}.\n\nAs []{move:thunder-wave} is prevented by immunities, unlike most non-damaging moves, it does not affect []{type:ghost}-type Pokémon under the effect of this ability."
