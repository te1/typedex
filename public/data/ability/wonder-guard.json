Damage not directly dealt by moves, such as damage from [weather]{mechanic:weather}, a [status ailment]{mechanic:status-ailment}, or []{move:spikes}, is not prevented.\n\nThis ability cannot be copied with []{move:role-play} or traded away with []{move:skill-swap}, but it can be copied with []{ability:trace}, disabled with []{move:gastro-acid}, or changed with []{move:worry-seed}.  This Pokémon can still use Role Play itself to lose this ability, but not Skill Swap.\n\nIf this Pokémon has a []{move:substitute}, this ability will block moves as usual and any moves not blocked will react to the Substitute as usual."
