[]{move:gust} and []{move:twister} will additionally have double power.\n\nThe damage from []{move:hail} and []{move:sandstorm} still applies during this effect.\n\nEither Pokémon may be hit during this effect if also under the effect of []{move:lock-on}, []{move:mind-reader}, or []{ability:no-guard}.\n\nThis move cannot be used while []{move:gravity} is in effect.\n\nThis move cannot be selected by []{move:sleep-talk}.\n\n*Bug*: If []{move:gravity} is used during a double or triple battle while this move is in effect, this move is not correctly canceled on the target, and it remains high in the air indefinitely.  As this move prevents the target from acting, the only way to subsequently remove it from the field is to faint it."
