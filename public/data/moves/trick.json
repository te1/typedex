This applies even if both Pokémon had a choice item before this move was used.  If the first of the two Pokémon gains a choice item, it may select whatever choice move it wishes next turn.\n\nNeither the user nor the target can recover its item with recycle.\n\nThis move cannot be selected by assist or metronome."
