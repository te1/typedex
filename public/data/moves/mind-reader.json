This effect also allows the user to hit Pokémon that are off the field due to moves such as dig or fly.\n\nIf the target uses detect or protect while under the effect of this move, the user is not guaranteed to hit, but has a (100 - accuracy)% chance to break through the protection.\n\nThis effect is passed on by baton pass."
