Pokémon otherwise immune to ground moves are affected during gravity.\n\nIf a poison Pokémon not immune to ground moves enters a field covered with poisoned spikes, the spikes are removed.\n\nrapid spin will remove this effect from its user's side of the field.  defog will remove this effect from its target's side of the field.\n\nThis move does not trigger synchronize, unless the Pokémon with synchronize was forced to enter the field by another effect such as roar.\n\nPokémon entering the field due to baton pass are not affected by this effect."
