# typedex

typedex is a simple web app that shows type effectiveness in Pokemon battles. Quickly find damage done and damage taken for different type matchups without having to consult an unwieldy type chart.


## Features

- Show damage taken by Pokemon type
- Show damage done by move type
- **TODO** Show list of Pokemon (name, type(s) and picture)
- Show list of moves (name and type)
- **TODO** Search by name (with autocomplete) for Pokemon and moves


## Motivation

I just can't remember type matchups in Pokemon games so I needed a quick and easy way to look up this information while playing. There are already solutions out there (like https://pkmn.help) but none of them did it in a way that I found satisfying. Also, I wanted to use this as an opportunity to learn more about and use certain technologies that I haven't used (much) before.
